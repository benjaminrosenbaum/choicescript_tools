# graph.rb -- draws a graph of your story's paths, based on annotations, using graphViz

# Instructions: Override these variables: DEVDIR, PROJNAME
# DEVDIR can be an absoulte path, or a paths relative to your home directory 
# using "~" to represent that directory.
#
# You can either set the CST_DEVDIR and CST_PROJNAME environment variables 
# in your shell, like this:
#    export CST_DEVDIR="/Developer/gamedev/myproj"
# ...or you can modify this file to change the defaults.
#
# PROJNAME should be the name of the directory within DEVDIR that contains your ".txt" 
# files.
#
# The graph output will be placed in DEVDIR/PROJNAME/maps/PROJNAME.png

	Usage: graph.rb [projname]

	    Draws a graph of your story's paths, based on annotations, using graphViz.js

	    Set up the CST_DEVDIR environment variables to point to your development
	    directory, and place your .txt files in a PROJNAME directory within it.

	    You must have the graphViz \"dot\" utility installed. See https://graphviz.org

	    In your ChoiceScript code, add comments prefixed with a pipe character \"|\", 
	    showing transitions between labels with \"->\" and optionally, \"TODO\" and 
	    \"DOING\" states. Typically you'll want to add these comments right 
	    before significant labels:

	    *comment | finished_func -> choice_being_worked_on
	    *comment | finished_func -> choice_not_yet_started
	    *comment | finished_func -> choice_finished
	    *label finished_func
	    	*choice 
	    		# Do a thing.
	    			*goto choice_not_yet_started
	            # Do a different thing.
	    			*goto choice_being_worked_on
	    	    # Do something entirely different
	    	    	*goto choice_finished

		*comment | choice_not_yet_started TODO
	    *label choice_not_yet_started
	    haven't gotten to this yet... 

	    *comment | choice_being_worked_on DOING
	    *label choice_being_worked_on
	    work in progress... 

	    *label choice_finished
	    Wow, that's different!
